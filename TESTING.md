- ✅ Debug trait implementation

#### Memory Tables (`mem_table.rs`) - 13 tests
- ✅ MemTable creation and initialization

### CherryCore Crate (28 tests)
The `cherrycore` crate contains shared types and JWT authentication with full test coverage:

#### JWT Authentication (`jwt.rs`) - 11 tests
- ✅ JWT configuration
- ✅ JWT claims creation and validation
- ✅ Token generation and parsing
- ✅ Invalid token handling
- ✅ Authentication error handling
- ✅ Error response conversion
- ✅ Keys creation and usage
- ✅ Serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Debug trait implementations

#### Type Definitions (`types.rs`) - 17 tests
- ✅ Login request/response serialization
- ✅ OAuth login handling
- ✅ Stream operation request/response types
- ✅ Response error handling and HTTP status codes
- ✅ Stream and conversation data structures
- ✅ Base64 encoding for binary data
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Debug trait implementations
- ✅ Error conversion from anyhow

## Running Tests

### Quick Test Run
Use the provided test runner script:
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

### Manual Test Execution
Run tests for individual crates:

```bash
# StreamStore tests
cd crates/streamstore
cargo test

# CherryCore tests (requires JWT_SECRET environment variable)
cd crates/cherrycore
JWT_SECRET=test_secret_key_for_testing cargo test

# Both crates together
JWT_SECRET=test_secret_key_for_testing cargo test -p streamstore -p cherrycore
```

### Test Environment Setup
Some tests require environment variables:
- `JWT_SECRET`: Required for JWT-related tests in cherrycore

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Functionality Tests**: Verify core business logic
- **Error Handling Tests**: Ensure proper error conditions and messages
- **Serialization Tests**: Validate JSON/binary serialization
- **Concurrency Tests**: Test thread safety and concurrent access
- **Edge Case Tests**: Handle boundary conditions and invalid inputs

### Integration Points
- **Cross-Module Integration**: Tests that verify interaction between modules
- **Data Format Compatibility**: Ensure encoding/decoding consistency
- **Error Propagation**: Verify error handling across module boundaries

## Test Quality Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Happy Path Testing**: Normal operation scenarios
- **Error Path Testing**: Exception and error conditions
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and limits
- **Concurrency Testing**: Multi-threaded scenarios

### Test Reliability
- **Deterministic Tests**: Consistent results across runs
- **Isolated Tests**: No dependencies between test cases
- **Clean Up**: Proper resource cleanup (temporary files, etc.)
- **Environment Independence**: Tests work in different environments

### Maintainability
- **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive test function names
- **Good Documentation**: Comments explaining complex test scenarios
- **Modular Structure**: Tests organized by functionality
- **Easy to Extend**: Simple to add new tests

## Known Limitations

### GTK Dependencies
The main `cherry` crate (Tauri application) requires GTK system dependencies that are not available in all environments. These tests are excluded from the automated test suite but can be run manually in environments with proper GTK setup.

### Integration Tests
The current test suite focuses on unit tests. Integration tests that require database connections, network access, or complex service interactions are not included but could be added in the future.

### Performance Tests
While the tests include some large data scenarios, dedicated performance and benchmark tests are not included in the current suite.

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Integration Tests**: Add tests for database operations and API endpoints
2. **Property-Based Testing**: Use libraries like `proptest` for more comprehensive testing
3. **Benchmark Tests**: Add performance regression testing
4. **Mock Testing**: Add mocking for external dependencies
5. **Coverage Reporting**: Integrate with coverage tools like `tarpaulin`

### Test Infrastructure
1. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in continuous integration
2. **Test Data Management**: Structured test data and fixtures
3. **Parallel Test Execution**: Optimize test runtime
4. **Test Reporting**: Enhanced test result reporting and analysis

## Contributing to Tests

When adding new functionality:
1. **Write Tests First**: Consider test-driven development
2. **Test All Paths**: Include both success and error scenarios
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make test purposes clear
4. **Keep Tests Simple**: One concept per test
5. **Clean Up Resources**: Ensure proper cleanup in tests
6. **Document Complex Tests**: Add comments for non-obvious test logic

## Conclusion

The Cherry project now has a robust testing foundation with 70 comprehensive unit tests covering the core functionality. This provides confidence in code quality, helps prevent regressions, and makes the codebase more maintainable for future development.
